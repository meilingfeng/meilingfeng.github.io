# Identifying opportunities that benefit biodiversity, climate mitigation, and human communities
In this project with the National Audubon Society Science Department, we identified climate strongholds for birds, areas with high carbon mitigation, and vulnerable human communities and looked for areas where these three priorities overlapped across the continental US and Alaska. We also looked at areas with Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (IPLCs), communities that depend on the land for cultural preservation and livelihoods. The result was a map of national conservation priorities for birds, climate mitigation, and human well-being. We highlighted areas where IPLCs are prevelant, as these areas will be especially important for collaborative conservation and re-thinking what "counts as successful conservation.
